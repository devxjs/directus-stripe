## Database Installation

Installing a database is a straightforward process. You has 2 option: 

### Fresh Installation using a Directus Snapshot

1) First, download the  <a href="/directus-stripe//snapshot.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" download>Snapshot</a>.

2) Make sure to familiarize yourself with the [Directus Snapshot documentation](https://docs.directus.io/self-hosted/cli.html).

3) Now, load your snapshot using one of the following methods:

   - If you're using Docker, run the following command:
     ```bash
     docker exec docker-image-name npx directus schema apply --yes /directus/snapshots/snapshot.yaml
     ```

   - For a standard installation, use this command:
     ```bash
     npx directus schema apply ./path/to/snapshot.yaml
     ```

4) That's it! ðŸ˜Ž

## Creating Your First Order

To create your first order using the Directus admin panel or Directus API, follow these steps:

1. First, create your products in Directus.

2. Once your order is ready for payment, make a **POST** request to the following API endpoint:

    ```json
    http://your-directus-domain/stripe/payment/{order_id}
    ```
    
    Include the following information in the request body:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "First name Surname",
      "customer_email": "test@o2.pl",
      "phone": "+48 555 555 555",
      "address": {
        "line1": "Address line 1 (e.g., street, PO Box, or company name)",
        "city": "City, district, suburb, town, village, or ward",
        "country": "US",
        "line2": "Address line 2 (e.g., apartment, suite, unit, or building)",
        "postal_code": "ZIP or postal code"
      }
    }
    ```

    Ensure that you provide accurate customer information.

4. After making the request, you will receive a response containing a URL:

   ```json
   {
     "url": "https://checkout.stripe.com/c/pay/cs_test_...."
   }
   ```

   This URL will take you to the payment checkout page. The link and the expiration time are saved in your order for reference.

By following these steps, you can easily create and process your first order through Directus and Stripe.
